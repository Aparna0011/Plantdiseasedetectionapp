Leaf disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a deep learning approach 
for identifying plant diseases from leaf images. The system processes images through CNN layers 
to extract features like texture and color, enabling accurate classification. 
The model is trained on labeled datasets, using convolutional and pooling layers to detect disease patterns.
This technology is widely used in smart agriculture to assist farmers with early disease diagnosis,
automated crop monitoring, and precision farming, improving yield and reducing manual inspection efforts.
The system can be integrated into mobile apps or drones for large-scale disease detection.
